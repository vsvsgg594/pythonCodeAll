#sequence of various data types of stored .A list is a collection of different kinds of values or items.
# Since Python lists are mutable, we can change their elements after forming.
#The comma (,) and the square brackets [enclose the List's items] serve as separators.
#declaration of list
list=[1,2,3,4,"bihar"]
for i in list:
    print(i)
# Characteristics of Lists
# The characteristics of the List are as follows:

# The lists are in order.
# The list element can be accessed via the index.
# The mutable type of List is
# The rundowns are changeable sorts.
# The number of various elements can be stored in a list.    
# a = [ 1, 2, "Ram", 3.50, "Rahul", 5, 6 ]    
# b = [ 1, 2, 5, "Ram", 3.50, "Rahul", 6 ]    
# if(a==b):
#     print("yes")
# else:
#     print("no")  
# Python List Operations
# The concatenation (+) and repetition (*) operators work in the same way as they were working with the strings.
#  The different operations of list are

# Repetition
# Concatenation
# Length
# Iteration
# Membership     
# # Python List Built-in Functions
# Python provides the following built-in functions, which can be used with the lists.

# len()
# max()
# min() 
list1=[100,200,300]
print(len(list1))
print(max(list1))
print(min(list1))
